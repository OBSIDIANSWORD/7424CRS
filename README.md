CircleAnimation
==============

This is an assignment for my course whereby circles are meant to bounce around on screen, contact the walls and bounce
away from them. If they contact any other circle, they are to bounce off the circle. If they also bounce off a wall too,
then obviously, they must also bounce off that.
